Micronaut supports GraalVM and starting in `1.2.0` special configuration files have been added to make easier the native image creation.

The only change needed to create it is to add the dependency of the view technology used instead of the generic `micronaut-views`.
For example, when using Thymeleaf, instead of defining this dependency:

dependency:micronaut-views[]

Use this:

dependency:micronaut-views-thymeleaf[]
